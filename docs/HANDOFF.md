=== CONTEXT HANDOFF ===

📍 Working on: E2E Test Refactoring - Fix tests for text and voice workflows
🌿 Branch: issue-212-e2e-pytest-xdist  
📂 Directory: /Users/carlos/workspace/re-frame/tests/e2e

✅ Completed:
- Fixed JavaScript syntax errors in conftest.py (arrow functions → lambda)
- Fixed all .first() syntax errors (changed to .first property)
- Fixed button selectors ('Generate perspective' not 'Send')
- Fixed message counting logic (UI only shows assistant messages)
- Text workflow tests now PASSING with real backend
- Added fake media device flags for voice testing
- Identified voice test issues are due to browser limitations

🚧 In Progress:
- Voice workflow tests still have locator issues (multiple elements found)
- Need to run voice tests with fake media devices enabled
- Some locators need .first to resolve ambiguity

📝 Next Steps:
1. Run voice test with fixed locators: `HEADLESS=false uv run pytest test_real_voice_workflow.py -v`
2. Fix remaining strict mode violations in voice tests
3. Verify all voice UI elements work with fake media devices
4. Consider if voice tests should be marked as expected failures in CI

🔧 Key Commands:
- Fix conftest.py: `sed -i '' "s/msg => /lambda msg: /g" conftest.py`
- Run text tests: `uv run pytest test_real_text_workflow.py -v`
- Run voice tests (headed): `HEADLESS=false uv run pytest test_real_voice_workflow.py -v`
- Run simple test: `uv run pytest test_real_simple_workflow.py -v`

📎 Important Files:
- tests/e2e/conftest.py (KEEPS REVERTING - needs lambda syntax fix)
- tests/e2e/test_real_simple_workflow.py (✅ WORKING)
- tests/e2e/test_real_text_workflow.py (✅ WORKING)
- tests/e2e/test_real_voice_workflow.py (🔧 needs locator fixes)

⚠️ Critical Issues:
- conftest.py keeps reverting to JavaScript arrow function syntax
- Voice tests fail in headless mode (NotSupportedError)
- Solution: Added --use-fake-device-for-media-stream flags to conftest.py

🎯 Test Status:
- Simple text conversation: ✅ PASSED
- Complete text workflow: ✅ PASSED  
- Voice UI elements: ❌ Failing (locator ambiguity)
- Voice workflows: 🔄 Not fully tested

💡 Key Findings:
- Real backend integration WORKS perfectly
- SSE connections stable with heartbeats
- Real Gemini API responses confirmed
- Text workflows fully functional
- Voice requires fake media devices in browser
