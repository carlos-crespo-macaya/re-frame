=== CONTEXT HANDOFF ===

📍 Working on: Linear Issue CAR-28 - Add missing test coverage for UI components
🌿 Branch: issue-212-e2e-pytest-xdist
📂 Directory: /Users/carlos/workspace/re-frame

✅ Completed:
- Created comprehensive test suite for MessageBubble component (100% coverage)
- Created test suite for PlaybackControls component (92.3% coverage)
- Removed old TypeScript E2E test file (full-workflow.spec.ts)
- Created new E2E test infrastructure with Docker support
- Generated ALL audio fixtures using Google Cloud Text-to-Speech (10/10 files)
- Created voice conversation tests for both English and Spanish

🚧 Test Coverage Achieved:
- MessageBubble.tsx: 100% coverage
- PlaybackControls.tsx: 92.3% statement coverage, 100% function coverage
- Overall conversation components: 100% coverage

📝 E2E Test Matrix (4 combinations):
The goal is to test complete workflows with these variables:
1. **English + Text** - full-text-workflow.spec.ts
2. **English + Voice** - voice-english-fixtures.spec.ts
3. **Spanish + Text** - text-conversation.spec.ts (needs Spanish variant)
4. **Spanish + Voice** - voice-spanish-fixtures.spec.ts

Current test files:
- text-conversation.spec.ts - Simple text conversation flow
- voice-conversation.spec.ts - Basic voice UI testing
- full-text-workflow.spec.ts - Complete CBT conversation (English)
- full-voice-workflow.spec.ts - Voice with audio playback
- voice-english-fixtures.spec.ts - English voice with real TTS audio
- voice-spanish-fixtures.spec.ts - Spanish voice with real TTS audio

🎙️ Audio Fixtures (ALL COMPLETE):
English (5 files - 611.7KB total):
- en-greeting.wav (120.1KB)
- en-thought-1.wav (113.8KB)
- en-insight.wav (125.1KB)
- en-conclusion.wav (137.6KB)
- en-sleep-worry.wav (115.1KB)

Spanish (5 files - 727.5KB total):
- es-greeting.wav (151.7KB)
- es-thought-1.wav (145.0KB)
- es-insight.wav (149.2KB)
- es-conclusion.wav (174.0KB)
- es-social.wav (107.1KB) ✓ Fixed with es-ES-Standard-A voice

🔧 Key Commands:
- Generate audio fixtures: cd tests/e2e/fixtures && ./setup-and-generate.sh
- Run all E2E tests: ./run-e2e-docker.sh
- Run text tests only: ./run-e2e-docker.sh --text
- Run voice tests only: ./run-e2e-docker.sh --voice
- Debug mode: ./run-e2e-docker.sh --debug --keep-running
- Frontend unit tests: cd frontend && pnpm run test:ci

📊 Test Results:
- Unit tests: All passing with >80% coverage target met
- E2E tests: Ready to run with real audio fixtures
- Voice fixtures: 10/10 files generated successfully (all complete!)

🔑 Environment:
- GEMINI_API_KEY is set (used by backend)
- Google Cloud TTS authenticated via application default credentials
- Docker and Docker Compose available
- All 10 audio fixtures successfully generated

💡 Next Steps:
1. Create Spanish text workflow test (to complete the 4-combination matrix)
2. Run all E2E tests to verify workflows:
   - English + Text: full-text-workflow.spec.ts ✓
   - English + Voice: voice-english-fixtures.spec.ts ✓
   - Spanish + Text: (needs creation)
   - Spanish + Voice: voice-spanish-fixtures.spec.ts ✓
3. Verify all workflows complete successfully
4. Commit the test improvements
5. Update Linear issue CAR-28 as completed
