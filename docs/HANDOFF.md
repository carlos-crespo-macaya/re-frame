=== CONTEXT HANDOFF ===

📍 Working on: Voice Mode Implementation with ADK Streaming
🌿 Branch: issue-212-e2e-pytest-xdist
📂 Directory: /Users/carlos/workspace/re-frame/backend

✅ Completed:
- Fixed Python setup for self-hosted runners on Ubuntu 23.10
- Removed all old voice implementation code (including speech_to_text.py)
- Created new voice module with ADK streaming (`/backend/src/voice/`)
- Implemented voice endpoints: POST/GET/DELETE /api/voice/sessions/*
- Created text router and moved text endpoints from main.py
- Refactored main.py to only handle app setup and include routers
- Exported OpenAPI schema and regenerated frontend client
- Fixed all linting and formatting issues
- Fixed session_manager._sessions access issue (added list_sessions() method)
- Fixed asyncio.create_task warnings
- Fixed LiveRequestQueue type errors (use send_content() and close())
- Verified voice endpoints are included in API
- Generated frontend client with voice endpoints
- Adapted slash commands to use workspace docs/HANDOFF.md file

🚧 In Progress:
- Voice mode implementation using ADK's `run_live()` method with `LiveRequestQueue`
- Text and voice routers are now separate and clean
- Language parameter properly flows from frontend to both text and voice endpoints

⚠️ Quality Check Status:
**Backend**: ❌ Tests failing (73.37% coverage, needs 80%)
- Formatting/Linting/TypeCheck: ✅ All passing  
- Tests: 16 failed, 337 passed, 16 errors
- Main issue: test_main.py needs updates for endpoint moves

**Frontend**: ✅ All passing
- Linting: Pass with warnings
- TypeCheck: Pass
- Tests: All passing

📝 Next Steps:
1. Fix failing backend tests (test_main.py) - endpoints moved to routers
2. Update frontend to use new voice endpoints (generated client methods already available)
3. Clean up temporary documentation files created during implementation
4. Test the voice streaming functionality end-to-end
5. Ensure language selector properly sets language for voice sessions

🔧 Key Commands:
- Backend tests: `cd backend && uv run poe test`
- Backend checks: `cd backend && uv run poe check`
- Export OpenAPI: `cd backend && uv run poe export-openapi`
- Generate frontend client: `cd frontend && pnpm run generate:api`
- Run backend: `cd backend && uv run python -m uvicorn src.main:app --reload`
- Frontend checks: `cd frontend && pnpm run lint && pnpm run typecheck && pnpm run test`

🔗 References:
- Original issue: Working on voice mode that wasn't functioning
- User requirement: Use ADK streaming pattern (https://google.github.io/adk-docs/streaming/custom-st)
- Key constraint: All frontend-backend communication must go through auto-generated OpenAPI client

💡 Key Implementation Details:
- Voice uses separate endpoints (/api/voice/*) with ADK `run_live()` + `LiveRequestQueue`
- Text endpoints remain at /api/* with existing request-response pattern
- No backwards compatibility needed - complete replacement
- Using SSE for streaming responses, REST for control (OpenAPI compatible)
- Voice session creates ADK runner with `response_modalities=["AUDIO"]`
- Language parameter comes from frontend selector for both modes
- LiveRequestQueue methods: send_content() for content, close() to end
