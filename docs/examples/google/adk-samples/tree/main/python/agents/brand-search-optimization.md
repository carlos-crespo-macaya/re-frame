# Brand Search Optimization - Web Browser Agent for Search Optimization
[](https://github.com/google/adk-samples/tree/main/python/agents/brand-search-optimization#brand-search-optimization---web-browser-agent-for-search-optimization)
## Overview
[](https://github.com/google/adk-samples/tree/main/python/agents/brand-search-optimization#overview)
This agent is designed to enhance product data for retail websites. It generates keywords based on product data such as title, description, and attributes. It then visits a website, searches, and analyzes top results to provide suggestions for enriching product titles. This helps address issues like "Null & low recovery" or "Zero Results" searches by identifying gaps in product data. The agent can be extended to support enriching descriptions and attributes. Key tools it uses are: computer use and bigquery data connection.
## Agent Details
[](https://github.com/google/adk-samples/tree/main/python/agents/brand-search-optimization#agent-details)
This agent showcases Multi Agent setup with tool calling and web crawling

### Agent Architecture
[](https://github.com/google/adk-samples/tree/main/python/agents/brand-search-optimization#agent-architecture)
[![Brand Search Optimization](https://github.com/google/adk-samples/raw/main/python/agents/brand-search-optimization/brand_search_optimization.png)](https://github.com/google/adk-samples/blob/main/python/agents/brand-search-optimization/brand_search_optimization.png)
### Key Features
[](https://github.com/google/adk-samples/tree/main/python/agents/brand-search-optimization#key-features)
  * **Tools:**
    * `function_calling`: Gets data from the product catalog i.e. BigQuery table based on user provided brand. It takes a brand string as input and returns a list of database records.
    * `load_artifacts_tool`: Load web page source data as an artifact to analyze the components to take action such as clicking on the search button.
    * `Website crawling`: Achieved through several individual tools such as `go_to_url`,`take_screenshot`,`find_element_with_text`, `click_element_with_text`,`enter_text_into_element`, `scroll_down_screen`,`get_page_source`,`analyze_webpage_and_determine_action`
  * **Evaluation:** The agent uses OOTB evaluation provided by the ADK and it can be run using `sh deployment/eval.sh` script.


## Setup and Installation
[](https://github.com/google/adk-samples/tree/main/python/agents/brand-search-optimization#setup-and-installation)
  1. **Prerequisites:**
     * Python 3.11+
     * Poetry
       * For dependency management and packaging. Please follow the instructions on the official [Poetry website](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) for installation.
     * A project on Google Cloud Platform
     * Get your API key from [here](https://aistudio.google.com).(Not needed if you want to use Gemini from Vertex AI)
  2. **Configuration:**
     * Env file setup
       * Copy example env file `cp env.example .env`
       * Set `DISABLE_WEB_DRIVER=1`
       * Add values for following variables in the `.env` file
         * `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=<YOUR_PROJECT>`
         * `GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION=<YOUR_LOCATION>`
     * **API Keys:**
       * Your API key should be added under `.env` in `GOOGLE_API_KEY` variable
       * You don't need both Google API key and the Vertex AI setup. Either set up will work.
     * **BigQuery Setup**
       * BigQuery DATASET_ID should be under `.env` in `DATASET_ID`
       * BigQuery TABLE_ID should be under `.env` in `TABLE_ID`
       * BigQuery table setup can be done using automatically following the `sh deployment/run.sh` below or manually by following steps in `BigQuery Setup` section.
     * **Other Configuration:**
       * You can change Gemini Model by changing `MODEL` under `.env`
       * `DISABLE_WEB_DRIVER` when set to `1`, will enable you to run unit tests. See `Unit Tests` section below for details. **NOTE** keep this flag to 0 by default when not testing.
  3. **Authenticate with your Google Cloud account:**
```
gcloud auth application-default login
```

  4. **Installation:**
     * Install dependencies and populate database using `deployment/run.sh`
```
# Clone this repository.
git clone https://github.com/google/adk-samples.git
cd adk-samples/python/agents/brand-search-optimization
# Run This script
# 1. Creates and activates a new virtual env
# 2. Installs python packages
# 3. Populates BigQuery data using variables set in `.env` file
sh deployment/run.sh
```

     * Set `DISABLE_WEB_DRIVER=0`


## Running the Agent
[](https://github.com/google/adk-samples/tree/main/python/agents/brand-search-optimization#running-the-agent)
You have to run the `adk run brand_search_optimization` to make the agent run.
You may also run the web app using `adk web`.
The command `adk web` will start a web server on your machine and print the URL. You may open the URL and interact with the agent in a chatbot interface. The UI is initially blank.
Select "brand-search-optimization" from the drop-down menu.
> **NOTE** This should open a new chrome window through web-driver. If it doesn't, please make sure `DISABLE_WEB_DRIVER=0` in the `.env` file.
### Brand Name
[](https://github.com/google/adk-samples/tree/main/python/agents/brand-search-optimization#brand-name)
  * If you ran the `deployment/run.sh` script. The agent will be pre-configured for the brand `BSOAgentTestBrand`. When the agent asks for a brand name, please provide `BSOAgentTestBrand` as your brand name.
  * For custom data, please modify the brand name.
  * The agent flow triggers when you provide a brand name.


> **NOTE**
>   * Don't close the extra chrome window opened by the agent.
>   * After the agent provides a list of keywords, ask the agent to search a website. e.g. "Can you search website?", "Can you search of keywords on website?", "Help me search for keywords on website" etc.
>   * While visiting Google Shopping website, you'll need to complete the captcha for the first run. After completing the captcha, the agent should run in the subsequent runs.

### Example Interaction
[](https://github.com/google/adk-samples/tree/main/python/agents/brand-search-optimization#example-interaction)
One example session is provided to illustrate how the Brand Search Optimizer operates for the brand BSOAgentTestBrand with Google Shopping - [`example_interaction.md`](https://github.com/google/adk-samples/blob/main/python/agents/brand-search-optimization/tests/example_interaction.md)
This file contains a full dialog history between the user and various agents and tools, from keyword finding to a full comparison report between titles of the top search 3 results.
> **Disclaimer** This sample uses Google Shopping website for demonstration purposes, but it is up to you to ensure you are following the website's terms of service.
## Evaluating the Agent
[](https://github.com/google/adk-samples/tree/main/python/agents/brand-search-optimization#evaluating-the-agent)
This uses ADK's evaluation component to evaluate brand search optimization agent with evalset inside `eval/data/` with configs defined in `eval/data/test_config.json`
You must be inside `brand-search-optimization` dir and then run
```
sh deployment/eval.sh
```

## Unit Tests
[](https://github.com/google/adk-samples/tree/main/python/agents/brand-search-optimization#unit-tests)
Run unit test using `pytest` by following these steps
  1. Modify this in `.env` `DISABLE_WEB_DRIVER=1`
  2. Run `sh deployment/test.sh`


This script runs unit test with a mock BQ client for BigQuery tool in `tests/unit/test_tools.py`.
## Deploying the Agent
[](https://github.com/google/adk-samples/tree/main/python/agents/brand-search-optimization#deploying-the-agent)
The Agent can be deployed to Vertex AI Agent Engine using the following command:
Modify this in `.env` -> `DISABLE_WEB_DRIVER=1`
```
python deployment/deploy.py --create
```

You may also modify the deployment script for your use cases.
## Customization
[](https://github.com/google/adk-samples/tree/main/python/agents/brand-search-optimization#customization)
How to customize
  * **Modifying the Conversation Flow:** To ask the agent to compare descriptions instead of titles, you can change the prompt in `brand_search_optimization/sub_agents/search_results/prompt.py` specifically, `<Gather Information>` section under `SEARCH_RESULT_AGENT_PROMPT` can be changed.
  * **Changing the Data Sources:** BigQuery table can be configured to point to a table by changing values inside `.env` file
  * **Changing website:** Example website here is Google Shopping, please replace with your own, and modify any code accordingly.


### BigQuery Setup
[](https://github.com/google/adk-samples/tree/main/python/agents/brand-search-optimization#bigquery-setup)
#### Automation
[](https://github.com/google/adk-samples/tree/main/python/agents/brand-search-optimization#automation)
`sh deployment/run.sh` runs a script that populates BigQuery table with sample data. It calls `python tools/bq_populate_data.py` script behind the scene.
#### Dataset and Table permissions
[](https://github.com/google/adk-samples/tree/main/python/agents/brand-search-optimization#dataset-and-table-permissions)
If you want to run the agent on a BigQuery Table NOT owned by you, See instructions [here](https://github.com/google/adk-samples/blob/main/python/agents/brand-search-optimization/customization.md) to grant necessary permissions.
#### Manual Steps
[](https://github.com/google/adk-samples/tree/main/python/agents/brand-search-optimization#manual-steps)
Check the SQL queries inside `deployment/bq_data_setup.sql` for manually adding data
## Troubleshooting and Common Issues
[](https://github.com/google/adk-samples/tree/main/python/agents/brand-search-optimization#troubleshooting-and-common-issues)
### BigQuery data not present
[](https://github.com/google/adk-samples/tree/main/python/agents/brand-search-optimization#bigquery-data-not-present)
This relates to - Data set not found, data set not found in the location, User doesn't have permission for the bigquery dataset
Error:
```
google.api_core.exceptions.NotFound: 404 Not found: Dataset ...:products_data_agent was not found in location US; reason: notFound, message: Not found: Dataset ...:products_data_agent was not found in location US
```

Fix: Make sure you follow the `BigQuery Setup` section
### Selenium issues
[](https://github.com/google/adk-samples/tree/main/python/agents/brand-search-optimization#selenium-issues)
This relates to Selenium / Webdriver issues
Error:
```
selenium.common.exceptions.SessionNotCreatedException: Message: session not created: probably user data directory is already in use, please specify a unique value for --user-data-dir argument, or don't use --user-data-dir
```

Fix: Remove the data directory
```
rm -rf /tmp/selenium
```

### Agent flow issues
[](https://github.com/google/adk-samples/tree/main/python/agents/brand-search-optimization#agent-flow-issues)
#### Known Issues
[](https://github.com/google/adk-samples/tree/main/python/agents/brand-search-optimization#known-issues)
  * Agent doesn't run reliably when website enforces checks for bots and when the search element is hidden.
  * Agent doesn't suggest next step - This happens after keyword finding stage. Ask the agent to search for the top keyword in this case. e.g. "can you search for keyword?" or more explicitly "transfer me to web browser agent"
  * Agent asks for the keyword again - e.g. `Okay, I will go to XYZ.com. What keyword do you want to search for on XYZ?`. Please provide the keyword again.
