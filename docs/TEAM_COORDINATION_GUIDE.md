## Project Overview

We're building a CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) Assistant as a monorepo with:
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 (TypeScript) - Currently in `re-frame` repo
- **Backend**: FastAPI with Google ADK (Python) - Currently in `reframe-agents` repo
- **Timeline**: 3.5 weeks for POC completion
- **Total Issues**: 32 across 3 epics

## Project Board Access

### ðŸ“‹ Main Project Board
**URL**: https://github.com/users/macayaven/projects/7  
**Name**: CBT Assistant POC

### Column Structure
1. **Backlog** (Gray) - Issues not ready to start
2. **Ready** (Blue) - Dependencies met, ready to start
3. **In Progress** (Yellow) - Active development (max 1 per person)
4. **In Review** (Purple) - PR created and under review
5. **Done** (Green) - PR merged to main

### How to Update Issue Status
1. **Drag and drop** issues between columns on the board
2. **Or** use issue comments:
   - `/project "CBT Assistant POC" status:"In Progress"`
   - `/project "CBT Assistant POC" status:"In Review"`

## Workflow Methodology

### 1. Epic Flow
```
Epic 0 (Migration) â†’ Epic 1 (Local Docker) â†’ Testing Gate â†’ Epic 2 (Cloud Run)
```

**IMPORTANT**: 
- Complete Epic 0 before starting Epic 1
- Complete and test Epic 1 locally before starting Epic 2
- No skipping ahead!

### 2. Issue Lifecycle

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Backlog] --> B[Ready]
    B --> C[In Progress]
    C --> D[In Review]
    D --> E[Done]
    D --> C[Changes Requested]
```

### 3. Daily Workflow

1. **Morning Sync** (15 min)
   - Check project board
   - Update issue status
   - Identify blockers

2. **Development**
   - Pick ONE issue from "Ready"
   - Move to "In Progress"
   - Create feature branch
   - Implement solution

3. **End of Day**
   - Push code to branch
   - Update issue comments
   - Move blocked items back to "Ready"

## Git Conventions

### Branch Naming
```
<type>/<epic>-<issue>-<brief-description>

Examples:
feat/epic-0-135-prepare-repo-structure
fix/epic-1-142-audio-conversion-bug
docs/epic-s1-164-integration-docs
```

**Types**:
- `feat` - New feature
- `fix` - Bug fix
- `docs` - Documentation
- `test` - Testing
- `refactor` - Code refactoring
- `ci` - CI/CD changes

### Commit Messages
```
[<Epic>-<Issue>] <type>: <brief description>

<detailed description if needed>

Examples:
[Epic-0.1] feat: restructure repository for monorepo
[Epic-1.3] fix: handle 48kHz to 16kHz audio conversion
[Epic-S1] docs: add API contract documentation
```

### Working with Monorepo

After Epic 0 completion, the structure will be:
```
re-frame/
â”œâ”€â”€ backend/     # Python backend code
â”œâ”€â”€ frontend/    # Next.js frontend code
â”œâ”€â”€ docs/        # Shared documentation
â””â”€â”€ scripts/     # Shared scripts
```

**Important**: Always run commands from the appropriate directory!

## Pull Request Process

### 1. Creating a PR

**Title Format**:
```
[Epic-X.Y] Brief description of changes
```

**PR Template**:
```markdown
## Summary
Brief description of what this PR accomplishes

## Related Issue
Closes #<issue-number>

## Type of Change
- [ ] Bug fix

```

### 2. Review Process

1. **Self Review First**
   - Check your own PR
   - Ensure all checks pass
   - Test locally

2. **Request Review**
   - Frontend PRs: Request from frontend team lead
   - Backend PRs: Request from backend team lead
   - Shared PRs: Request from both teams

3. **Address Feedback**
   - Respond to all comments
   - Push fixes as new commits
   - Re-request review when ready

### 3. Merging Rules

- âœ… All CI checks must pass
- âœ… At least 1 approval required
- âœ… No unresolved conversations
- âœ… Up to date with main branch
- âœ… Linked issue moves to "Done" automatically

## CI/CD Checks

### Current Checks (Pre-Migration)

**Frontend (re-frame)**:
```yaml
- Next.js build
- TypeScript compilation
- ESLint
- Jest tests
- Lighthouse CI (performance)
```

**Backend (reframe-agents)**:
```yaml
- Python linting (ruff)
- Type checking (mypy)
- Unit tests (pytest)
- Security scan
```

### Post-Migration Checks (Monorepo)

We need to implement:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
name: CI

on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  # Detect changed files
  changes:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    outputs:
      frontend: ${{ steps.filter.outputs.frontend }}
      backend: ${{ steps.filter.outputs.backend }}
    steps:
      - uses: dorny/paths-filter@v2
        id: filter
        with:
          filters: |
            frontend:
              - 'frontend/**'
            backend:
              - 'backend/**'

  # Frontend checks
  frontend:
    needs: changes
    if: ${{ needs.changes.outputs.frontend == 'true' }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Frontend Tests
        run: |
          cd frontend
          npm ci
          npm run lint
          npm run type-check
          npm run test
          npm run build

  # Backend checks
  backend:
    needs: changes
    if: ${{ needs.changes.outputs.backend == 'true' }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Backend Tests
        run: |
          cd backend
          pip install uv
          uv sync
          uv run ruff check
          uv run mypy src
          uv run pytest

  # Integration tests (always run)
  integration:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Integration Tests
        run: |
          docker-compose up -d
          npm run test:e2e
          docker-compose down
```

### Required Checks Per Epic

**Epic 0 (Migration)**:
- Basic file structure validation
- Git history preserved
- README updated

**Epic 1 (Local Docker)**:
- Docker build succeeds
- docker-compose up works
- Basic integration test passes

**Epic 2 (Cloud Run)**:
- Production build succeeds
- Security scan passes
- Performance benchmarks met

## Communication Guidelines

### 1. GitHub Issues
- **Updates**: Comment on issues daily with progress
- **Blockers**: Tag relevant team members
- **Questions**: Use issue comments, not Slack/Discord

### 2. GitHub Discussions
**Enable GitHub Discussions** in repo Settings â†’ Features â†’ Discussions

**Categories to create**:
- **ðŸ“¢ Announcements** - Project updates and decisions
- **ðŸ’¬ General** - General project discussion  
- **ðŸŽ¯ Daily Standups** - Daily progress updates
- **ðŸš¨ Blockers** - Urgent issues that need attention
- **ðŸ’¡ Ideas** - Feature suggestions and improvements
- **ðŸ“š Resources** - Useful links and documentation
- **ðŸŽ‰ Show and Tell** - Demo completed features

**How to use**:
- **Daily Standups**: Create a new discussion each week titled "Week of [Date] - Daily Standups"
- **Blockers**: Create immediately when blocked, tag relevant team members with @mentions
- **Decisions**: Document in Announcements, then update relevant docs
- **Questions**: Post in General, tag people who can help

### 3. Meetings
- **Daily Standup**: 9:00 AM (15 min)
- **Weekly Demo**: Fridays 3:00 PM
- **Retrospective**: End of each epic

### 4. Documentation
- Update docs as you code
- Document decisions in ADRs (Architecture Decision Records)
- Keep README files current
