## Technical Integration Points

### Frontend â†’ Backend API Calls

1. **SSE Connection** (Text Mode):
   - GET `/api/events/{session_id}?language={lang}`
   - Establishes event stream
   - Receives: connected event, text responses, completion events

2. **Send Text Message**:
   - POST `/api/send/{session_id}`
   - Body: `{ mime_type: "text/plain", content: "user message" }`
   - Response: Message acknowledgment

3. **SSE Connection** (Voice Mode):
   - GET `/api/events/{session_id}?is_audio=true&language={lang}`
   - Establishes audio event stream
   - Receives: connected event, audio/pcm data, transcriptions

4. **Send Audio Message**:
   - POST `/api/send/{session_id}`
   - Body: `{ mime_type: "audio/wav", content: "base64_audio" }`
   - Response: Message acknowledgment

5. **Health Check**:
   - GET `/health`
   - Verifies backend availability

6. **Download PDF**:
   - GET `/api/pdf/{session_id}`
   - Returns: PDF file download

7. **Session Info**:
   - GET `/api/session/{session_id}`

## Testing Priority

### P0 - Critical Paths
1. Text-based reframing (core functionality)
2. Basic error handling
3. SSE connection management

### P1 - Important Features  
1. Voice conversation mode
2. Language switching
3. Crisis detection

### P2 - Nice to Have
1. PDF download
2. Theme switching
3. Session history

## Notes for Test Implementation

- All tests should run against Docker Compose environment
- Use stable test data and mock responses where appropriate
- Test both successful paths and error scenarios
- Verify frontend-backend integration, not unit functionality
- Focus on user-visible behavior and outcomes
