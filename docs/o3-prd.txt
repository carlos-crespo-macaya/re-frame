Below is the updated project specification—ready to paste into the O3 model—to generate the full PRD.
This version adds the domain you secured: re-frame.social.

🧠 O3 Input for PRD Generation (Final, with Domain)

I’m building an MVP of a web-based support tool for people with Avoidant Personality Disorder (AvPD).
The MVP will live on Google Cloud Platform within a $300 credit budget, use Google LLMs via Vertex AI, and orchestrate agents with the Google AI Developer Kit (ADK).
The public domain is re-frame.social.

Please generate a comprehensive Product Requirements Document (PRD) that includes:
	•	Executive summary
	•	Target users & personas
	•	User stories
	•	Functional requirements
	•	Architecture overview
	•	Agent design
	•	Data model (Firestore + FAISS)
	•	Anti-abuse mechanisms
	•	Tech stack
	•	Phased roadmap (each phase delivers a usable product)
	•	Success metrics per phase
	•	Open questions (with proposed answers)
	•	Future expansion ideas

Here is the project spec you should base it on:

⸻

📘 Project Name & Domain

Perspective (working title)
Public URL: https://re-frame.social

⸻

🌱 Purpose

Provide transparent, AI-assisted cognitive reframing for people with AvPD. Users describe a distressing situation; the system applies evidence-based frameworks (starting with CBT) and exposes the reasoning path to build trust and self-insight.

⸻

👥 Target Users
	•	Individuals with AvPD or severe social anxiety
	•	People who avoid therapy but want structured self-help
	•	Anyone seeking a transparent way to challenge distorted thoughts

⸻

🔄 User Journey
	1.	Visit re-frame.social (anonymous or logged-in).
	2.	Describe a distressing situation (text/voice).
	3.	Intake Agent gathers essential details.
	4.	Framework Agent (CBT in MVP) delivers reframing + reasoning.
	5.	User can star the insight, give feedback, or ask follow-up questions.
	6.	Data stored in Firestore; semantic vectors in FAISS.

⸻

🧠 Agent Architecture (via ADK)
	1.	Intake Agent – collects structured data.
	2.	Framework Agent (CBT) – identifies distortions, reframes, outputs reasoning.
	3.	Synthesis Agent – formats response (single framework in MVP).
	4.	Knowledge Agent – writes to Firestore + FAISS.
	5.	Query Agent – answers user questions from personal and curated knowledge.

⸻

📂 Storage
	•	Firestore document DB for sessions, starred items, feedback.
	•	FAISS vector DB (Cloud Run micro instance) for semantic search.

⸻

🛡️ Abuse Safeguards
	•	Rate-limit: 5 submissions/hour/IP (anonymous).
	•	Perspective API toxicity filter.
	•	Cool-down (1–2 min) between anonymous posts.
	•	Ethical use disclaimer before first interaction.

⸻

🧪 Feature Decisions
	•	Users may save/star reframings and leave feedback.
	•	Anonymous sessions may expire (configurable).
	•	No tone selector in MVP.
	•	Follow-up prompts are proactive until enough data is captured, then suggested questions appear.
	•	Only one framework (CBT) in Phase 1 to control scope.

⸻

🖥️ Tech Stack

Layer	Tech
LLMs	Gemini 1.5 / PaLM via Vertex AI
Agents	Google ADK
Backend	FastAPI on Cloud Run
Storage	Firestore + FAISS
Auth	Firebase (optional)
Frontend	Next.js + Tailwind (mobile-first)
Domain	re-frame.social (served via Cloud Run/Firebase Hosting)


⸻

🚀 Phased Roadmap

Phase	Key Deliverable	Timeline
P0 Alpha	One-page form → CBT reframing (in-memory)	2 wks
P1 MVP	Conversational intake, Firestore, stars, feedback, abuse filter	6 wks
P2 Multi-Framework	Add Self-Compassion + ACT, synthesis view	6 wks
P3 Knowledge & Query	Persistent accounts, FAISS queries, dashboard	8 wks

(Each phase deploys to re-frame.social and is fully usable.)

⸻

📈 Success Metrics (highlight per phase)
	•	25 unique users completing a reflection by end of P1.
	•	<10 % abuse-flagged sessions.
	•	≥60 % “Helpful” feedback on reframing usefulness (P1).

⸻

❓ Open Questions (with provisional answers)
	1.	CBT sub-model? Opt for Burns’ 10 common distortions (concise).
	2.	Anonymous session TTL? Purge after 7 days to save costs and protect privacy.
	3.	Perspective API quota? Free tier suffices under rate limits; monitor logs.

⸻

🔮 Future Ideas
	•	Voice-to-voice mode, therapist portal, progress analytics, community layer.
