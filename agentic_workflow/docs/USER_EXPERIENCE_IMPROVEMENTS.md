# User Experience Improvements

## What Changed

### Before: Confusing Multi-Agent Experience
- No introduction or explanation
- Unclear which "agent" was speaking
- Abrupt transitions between phases
- Raw JSON data shown to users
- Agent instructions leaked to users
- No clear process overview

### After: Maya - Your Cognitive Reframing Companion

#### 1. **Clear Introduction & Process Overview**
```
Hello! I'm Maya, your cognitive reframing companion. 🌱

I'm here to help you explore your thoughts and feelings using evidence-based CBT techniques. Our session will have three parts:

📝 Discovery Phase - I'll ask you a few questions to understand what you're experiencing
🔍 Reframing Phase - We'll examine your thoughts together and find more balanced perspectives  
📄 Summary Phase - I'll create a personalized PDF summary for you to keep

This is a safe, judgment-free space...
```

#### 2. **Visual Phase Transitions**
```
───────── 🔍 REFRAMING PHASE ─────────
Thank you for sharing that with me. I now have a good understanding of your situation. Let me help you explore a different perspective...
```

#### 3. **Single Agent Identity**
- Named "Maya" - friendly and approachable
- Consistent personality throughout
- Uses warm, empathetic language
- Subtle emoji usage for emotional connection (🌱 💙 ✨)

#### 4. **Natural Conversation Flow**
- One continuous conversation (not multiple agents)
- Smooth transitions between phases
- No technical details or JSON exposed
- Professional yet compassionate tone
