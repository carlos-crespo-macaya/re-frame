[![Agent Development Kit Logo](https://github.com/google/adk-docs/raw/main/docs/assets/agent-development-kit.png)](https://github.com/google/adk-docs/blob/main/docs/assets/agent-development-kit.png)
Welcome to the Sample Agents repository! This collection provides ready-to-use agents built on top of the [Agent Development Kit](https://github.com/google/adk-python), designed to accelerate your development process. These agents cover a range of common use cases and complexities, from simple conversational bots to complex multi-agent workflows.
## ‚ú® What are Sample Agents?
[](https://github.com/peteryxu/adk-samples#-what-are-sample-agents)
A Sample Agent is a functional starting point for a foundational agent designed for common application scenarios. It comes pre-packaged with core logic (like different agents using different tools, evaluation, human in the loop) relevant to a specific use case or industry. While functional, a Sample Agent typically requires customization (e.g., adjusting specific responses or integrating with external systems) to be fully operational. Each agent includes instructions on how it can be customized.
## üöÄ Getting Started
[](https://github.com/peteryxu/adk-samples#-getting-started)
Follow these steps to set up and run the sample agents:
  1. **Prerequisites:**
     * **Install the ADK Samples:** Ensure you have the Agent Development Kit installed and configured. Follow the [ADK Installation Guide](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/get-started/installation/).
     * **Set Up Environment Variables:** Each agent example relies on a `.env` file for configuration (like API keys, Google Cloud project IDs, and location). This keeps secrets out of the code.
       * You will need to create a `.env` file in each agent's directory you wish to run (usually by copying the provided `.env.example`).
       * Setting up these variables, especially obtaining Google Cloud credentials, requires careful steps. Refer to the **Environment Setup** section in the [ADK Installation Guide](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/get-started/installation/) for detailed instructions.
     * **Google Cloud Project (Recommended):** While some agents might run locally with just an API key, most leverage Google Cloud services like Vertex AI and BigQuery. A configured Google Cloud project is highly recommended. See the [ADK Quickstart](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/get-started/quickstart/) for setup details.
  2. **Clone this repository:** You can install the ADK samples via cloning it from the public repository by
```
git clone https://github.com/google/adk-samples.git
cd adk-samples
```

  3. **Explore the Agents:**


  * Navigate to the `agents/` directory.
  * The `agents/README.md` provides an overview and categorization of the available agents.
  * Browse the subdirectories. Each contains a specific sample agent with its own `README.md`.


  1. **Run an Agent:**
     * Choose an agent from the `agents/` directory.
     * Navigate into that agent's specific directory (e.g., `cd agents/llm-auditor`).
     * Follow the instructions in _that agent's_ `README.md` file for specific setup (like installing dependencies via `poetry install`) and running the agent.
Browse the folders in this repository. Each agent and tool have its own `README.md` file with detailed instructions.


**Notes:**
  * These agents have been built and tested using [Google models](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/learn/models) on Vertex AI. You can test these samples with other models as well. Please refer to [ADK Tutorials](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/agents/models/) to use other models for these samples.
