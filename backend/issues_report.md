# Project Issues Report

This document outlines issues and areas for improvement identified in the reframe-agents project.

## Critical Issues

### 1. Missing Docker Compose Configuration
- There is no docker-compose.yml file to orchestrate the application with potential frontend or other services
- This makes it difficult to run the complete application stack
- Need to create a docker-compose.yml that includes the backend service

### 2. Missing Google API Key Handling
- The .env.example file references GEMINI_API_KEY but the code looks for GOOGLE_API_KEY
- This inconsistency could cause confusion during setup

### 3. Incomplete Voice Implementation
- Voice functionality exists but is marked as optional
- The voice implementation may not be fully tested or integrated
- Voice tests are separate from core functionality tests

## High Priority Issues

### 4. Language Detection Deprecated But Still in Code
- Language detection endpoint exists but always returns English
- This creates confusion as to whether language detection is supported
- Should either fully implement or completely remove the endpoint

### 5. PDF Generation is Placeholder Only
- The PDF generation endpoint returns a plain text file, not an actual PDF
- For a production system, this needs to be properly implemented

### 6. Missing Frontend Integration
- No frontend code is included in the repository
- The static file serving is implemented but no files exist
- This makes it difficult to test the complete user experience

## Medium Priority Issues

### 7. Incomplete Test Coverage
- Some tests are marked with "pass" statements, indicating incomplete test coverage
- SSE streaming tests are complex and may not be fully implemented
- Voice functionality tests are separate and may not be regularly run

### 8. Documentation Gaps
- While there's good inline documentation, there's no comprehensive user guide
- The README.md has detailed setup instructions but lacks usage examples
- No documentation on how to extend the agent functionality

### 9. Error Handling Improvements
- Some error handling is basic and could be improved with more specific error messages
- Rate limiting is implemented for language detection but not for other endpoints

## Low Priority Issues

### 10. Code Duplication
- Some utility functions might be duplicated across files
- Session management logic exists in both text and voice implementations

### 11. Configuration Management
- Environment variable handling could be more centralized
- Some configuration values are hardcoded rather than configurable

### 12. Logging Improvements
- While structured logging is implemented, some log messages could be more descriptive
- More detailed performance monitoring could be added

## Recommendations

1. Create a docker-compose.yml file to orchestrate the application
2. Fix the API key environment variable inconsistency
3. Either fully implement language detection or remove the deprecated endpoint
4. Implement proper PDF generation functionality
5. Add comprehensive frontend integration examples
6. Improve test coverage, especially for SSE streaming and voice functionality
7. Create user documentation with usage examples
8. Enhance error handling with more specific messages
9. Refactor duplicated code and centralize configuration management
10. Improve logging with more descriptive messages

This report should help prioritize work on the project to improve its completeness and usability.
