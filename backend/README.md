# Backend - CBT Assistant API

This directory will contain the FastAPI backend with Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK).

## Structure (Coming Soon)

- `app/` - FastAPI application
- `agents/` - ADK agents and conversation logic
- `tests/` - Backend tests

The backend code will be merged here via git subtree from the reframe-agents repository.
