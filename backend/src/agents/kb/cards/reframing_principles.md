Reframing principles (no actions):
• Describe the thought neutrally; don't litigate the past.
• Name at most two distortions.
• Ask: "What evidence supports/contradicts the thought?"
• Offer one balanced sentence that could feel more true.
• Avoid prescriptions, steps, or tasks.
• Keep wording plain; avoid therapy jargon.
• Validate feelings while adjusting the appraisal.
• Keep it brief; one question per turn.
