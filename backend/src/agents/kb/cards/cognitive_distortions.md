Common cognitive distortions (ultra‑brief):
• All‑or‑nothing: only perfect or failure.
• Catastrophizing: assuming the worst outcome.
• Mind reading: assuming others' thoughts.
• Fortune telling: predicting without evidence.
• Overgeneralization: "always/never" from one event.
• Emotional reasoning: "I feel it, so it's true."
• Mental filter: focus only on the negative.
• Discounting positives: "It doesn't count."
• Should statements: rigid rules for self/others.
• Personalization: blaming yourself for externals.
Keep tone: curious, factual, non‑judgmental.
