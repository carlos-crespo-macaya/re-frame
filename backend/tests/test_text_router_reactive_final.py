"""Final TDD tests for reactive behavior in text router.

These tests verify the reactive SSE endpoint behavior where:
1. No greeting is sent on initial connection
2. Language detection overrides URL parameter for text responses
3. First message triggers appropriate greeting response
4. Session state correctly tracks greeting status

Note: These tests are written to FAIL initially (RED phase of TDD).
