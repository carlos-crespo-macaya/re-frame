# Issue #137 - CI/CD Workflows Status

## ✅ Completed by Frontend Team:
- [x] `.github/workflows/deploy-frontend.yml` - Frontend deployment workflow
- [x] `docker-compose.dev.yml` - Development environment overrides
- [x] `Makefile` - Common development commands
- [x] Updated `frontend/Dockerfile` with development stage
- [x] Created CI/CD workflow plan in `/docs/CI_CD_WORKFLOW_PLAN.md`

## ✅ Completed by Backend Team:
- [x] `.github/workflows/ci-monorepo.yml` - Main CI with path filtering
- [x] `.github/workflows/backend-ci.yml` - Backend-specific CI
- [x] Basic `docker-compose.yml`
- [x] Health check endpoint in backend
- [x] Backend Dockerfile configuration

## 🚧 Still Needed (Backend Team):
- [ ] `.github/workflows/deploy-backend.yml` - Backend deployment workflow
- [ ] `.github/workflows/integration-tests.yml` - Cross-component tests
- [ ] `docker-compose.test.yml` - Test environment configuration
- [ ] Update backend Dockerfile for development stage (optional)
- [ ] Test complete CI/CD pipeline

## 🚧 Still Needed (Frontend Team):
- [ ] Review and approve backend's CI changes
- [ ] Test frontend deployment workflow
- [ ] Ensure integration tests cover frontend/backend communication

## 📝 Notes:
- Both teams are working in separate git worktrees to avoid conflicts
- Frontend branch: `feat/issue-137-frontend-cicd`
- Backend branch: `feat/issue-137-backend-cicd`
- Will merge both branches once complete

## 🎯 Definition of Done:
- [ ] Frontend changes trigger only frontend CI/CD
- [ ] Backend changes trigger only backend CI/CD
- [ ] Both changes trigger integration tests
- [ ] Deployments work independently
- [ ] All workflows tested and passing
- [ ] PR created and approved
- [ ] Merged to main
