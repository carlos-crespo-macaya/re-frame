# Design Document

## Overview

This design outlines the approach for conducting a comprehensive analysis of the CBT Assistant POC monorepo. The analysis will use multiple MCP servers to gather data, analyze project health, and generate actionable recommendations.

## Architecture

### Analysis Components

1. **Project Structure Analysis**
   - File organization and naming conventions
   - Adherence to documented structure patterns
   - Missing or misplaced components

2. **Code Quality Assessment**
   - Frontend code quality (TypeScript, React patterns)
   - Backend code quality (Python, FastAPI patterns)
   - Configuration consistency
   - Documentation completeness

3. **Dependency Analysis**
   - Package versions and security vulnerabilities
   - Dependency conflicts or redundancies
   - Missing critical dependencies

4. **Testing and Coverage Analysis**
   - Test file presence and organization
   - Coverage gaps identification
   - Testing strategy alignment

5. **Deployment and DevOps Analysis**
   - Docker configuration completeness
   - CI/CD pipeline status
   - Environment configuration consistency

## Components and Interfaces

### MCP Server Integration

- **Sequential Thinking**: For structured analysis workflow
- **Context7**: For deep contextual understanding
- **Filesystem**: For comprehensive file analysis
- **Git**: For repository health assessment
- **Fetch**: For external dependency validation

### Analysis Workflow

1. **Discovery Phase**
   - Scan project structure
   - Identify all configuration files
   - Map dependencies and relationships

2. **Assessment Phase**
   - Evaluate each component against standards
   - Identify issues and categorize by severity
   - Assess alignment with project goals

3. **Solution Generation Phase**
   - Develop specific solutions for each issue
   - Estimate effort and impact
   - Prioritize recommendations

4. **Report Generation Phase**
   - Compile findings into comprehensive document
   - Organize by category and priority
   - Include actionable next steps

## Data Models

### Issue Model
```typescript
interface Issue {
  id: string;
  category: 'Structure' | 'Code Quality' | 'Dependencies' | 'Testing' | 'DevOps' | 'Documentation';
  severity: 'Critical' | 'High' | 'Medium' | 'Low';
  title: string;
  description: string;
  location: string;
  impact: string;
  solution: Solution;
}
```

### Solution Model
```typescript
interface Solution {
  description: string;
  steps: string[];
  effort: 'Small' | 'Medium' | 'Large';
  priority: number;
  dependencies: string[];
}
```

## Error Handling

- Graceful handling of missing files or directories
- Fallback analysis when MCP servers are unavailable
- Clear error reporting in final document

## Testing Strategy

- Validate analysis logic against known project patterns
- Test report generation with sample data
- Verify MCP server integration functionality
