Subject: CBT Assistant POC - Ready to Start! ðŸš€

Hi Backend Team,

Great news! The GitHub project structure is fully set up and ready for development. All 32 issues have been created, labeled, and organized on the project board.

## ðŸ“‹ Key Resources:

1. **Project Board**: https://github.com/users/macayaven/projects/7
   - Epic 0 issues are in "Ready" column - you can start!
   
2. **Your First Task**: Issue #136 - Merge backend code using git subtree
   - Coordinate with frontend on timing (they do #135 first)

3. **Essential Docs** (all in re-frame repo):
   - `/BACKEND_TEAM_KICKOFF.md` - Start here! Complete overview
   - `/docs/TEAM_COORDINATION_GUIDE.md` - How we work together
   - `/docs/MONOREPO_MIGRATION_CHECKLIST.md` - Migration steps

## ðŸŽ¯ Quick Actions:

1. Review the BACKEND_TEAM_KICKOFF.md document
2. Access the project board
3. Check your Epic 0 assignments
4. Enable GitHub Discussions for communication

## ðŸ“… Timeline:
- Week 1: Epic 0 (Monorepo Migration) 
- Week 2-3: Epic 1 (Local Docker)
- Week 4: Epic 2 (Cloud Run)

The integration plan we agreed on is now fully implemented in GitHub. We're using GitHub Discussions instead of Slack for all communication to keep everything centralized.

Ready when you are! Let's build something amazing together.

Best,
[Frontend Team]

P.S. All the coordination documents from our planning phase are preserved in the repos for reference.
