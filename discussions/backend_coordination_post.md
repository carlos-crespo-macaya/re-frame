# 🚀 Backend Team - Let's Start Epic 0!

Hi @backend-team,

Welcome to GitHub Discussions! This is our new communication hub for the CBT Assistant POC project. All 32 issues have been created and the project board is ready for action.

## 📋 Current Status

### Frontend Team
- **Issue #135** ([Epic-0.1] Prepare re-frame repository structure) - Currently **IN PROGRESS**
- Expected completion: Today/Tomorrow
- This needs to complete before you can start #136

### Backend Team - Ready to Start!
- **Issue #136** ([Epic-0.2] Merge backend code using git subtree) - **READY** (waiting for #135)
- **Issue #137** ([Epic-0.3] Update CI/CD workflows for monorepo) - Can start planning
- **Issue #139** ([Epic-0.5] Archive reframe-agents repository) - After merge complete

## 🎯 Immediate Actions for Backend Team

1. **Review your kickoff package**: `/BACKEND_TEAM_KICKOFF.md` in the re-frame repo
2. **Prepare for git subtree merge**:
   - Ensure reframe-agents repo is clean and ready
   - Review the migration checklist: `/docs/MONOREPO_MIGRATION_CHECKLIST.md`
   - Identify any final changes needed before merge

3. **Watch for #135 completion**: I'll notify you here as soon as it's done

## ⏰ Timeline Check

We're starting Week 1 of our 3.5-week sprint:
- **This week**: Complete Epic 0 (Monorepo Migration)
- **Next week**: Start Epic 1 (Local Docker Development)
- **Week 3**: Complete Epic 1 and testing
- **Week 4**: Epic 2 (Cloud Run Deployment)

## 🤝 Coordination Points

The main dependency right now is:
1. Frontend completes #135 (repo structure preparation)
2. Backend executes #136 (git subtree merge)
3. Both teams collaborate on #137 (CI/CD updates)
